Instructions for running code:

All code is found in a public Github repository and can be downloaded at: 

https://github.com/solb0039/CS7641.git

The code is written in R, and requires R to be preinstalled along with the following packages:
tidyverse, readxl, caret, adabag, rpart, nnet, NeuralNetTools &  e1071 

The folder consists of 5 R scripts:
1. HW1_DecisionTrees.R
2. HW1_Boosting.R
3. HW1_NeuralNet.R
4. HW1_SVM.R
5. HW1_kNN.R

The datafiles used in the analysis are also included in the folder.

Each R script is written to be run independently.  For example, to run the script `HW1_DecisionTrees.R`, type 
the following command into the terminal prompt:
	> R HW1_DecisionTree.R 

Alternatively, the script can be loaded into an active RStudio session and run by selection 'Run' from the toolbar.
